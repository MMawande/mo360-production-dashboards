## 0. Preamble

0.0 This Mercedes-Benz Inner Source License 1.0 succeeds the Daimler Inner Source License 1.0 as a later version and is similar in spirit.

0.1 Mercedes-Benz Group AG ("Mercedes-Benz") provides a platform for collaborative development ("SCR") and use of source code and associated data (e.g. parameters, documentation) for use by and for purposes of companies of the Mercedes-Benz Group (§§ 15 et seq. Aktiengesetz, German Stock Companies Act; all such companies together "Mercedes-Benz Companies"). This also includes the use by third parties only as far as these are commissioned directly by a Mercedes-Benz Company with performances for purposes of Mercedes-Benz Companies ("Commissioned Third Parties").

0.2 The SCR and cooperation model is named "Mercedes-Benz Inner Source Platform". Inner Source follows the pattern of Open Source software development, is however restricted to use by and for purposes of Mercedes-Benz Companies due to technical, security, relevance, and majority reasons.

0.3 Source code uploads to repositories ("Projects") on the SCR come with the expectation that other parties in this cooperation model will improve such Projects through comments, suggestions, source code to provide benefits of the collaboration for all involved parties.

## 1. Scope of ISL

1.1 The ISL is an agreement by a Mercedes-Benz Company or a Commissioned Third Party, which contributes to or uses content on the SCR ("Participant"), with Mercedes-Benz or another Mercedes-Benz Company also for the direct benefit of other Mercedes-Benz Companies and Commissioned Third Parties. The direct benefit of Commissioned Third Parties is limited to the grant of rights according to Section 4.4.

1.2 The ISL applies to Projects uploaded to or available on the SCR, especially source code and data, that contain this `LICENSE.md` file incorporating the unmodified ISL or that expressly refer to the ISL e.g., by stating "Licensed under Mercedes-Benz Inner Source License 1.0" (all together "Content").

1.3 The ISL applies to any and all handling and use of Content on the SCR, including copying, integration, making and/or making available modifications as well as any possible use of Content in foreseen or unforeseen manner by any means.

## 2. Consent to and Prevalence of ISL

2.1 The ISL is accepted by a Mercedes-Benz Company by accessing or making use of Content on the SCR through its employees or vicarious agents.

2.2 The ISL is accepted by a Commissioned Third Party by accessing or making use of Content on the SCR through its employees or vicarious agents. Subsidiarily, a user acting for a Commissioned Third Party accepts the ISL by such action for himself/herself and on behalf of such Commissioned Third Party.

2.3 Subsidiarily to Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the regulations in this ISL for rights to Content in Sections 3 and 4 are accepted by and apply analogously to any party, which contributes Content to the SCR, in respect of the offer of concession of rights according to Section 3.1 and the scope of rights granted according to Section 4. Such party is not able to accept an offer in respect of Content (see Section 3.2).

2.4 The ISL is prevalent for any Content on the SCR. Any exception from the ISL is only valid if and applicable as far as (i) the ISL itself expressly provides for other stipulations or such is expressly agreed upon in written form for each individual case and (ii) in any case the Content to which an exception applies is to be transparently marked as underlying different stipulations.

2.5 The ISL itself can only be terminated extraordinarily for good cause by notice in written form by one affected party to the other affected parties in respect of specific affected Content. Any obligations which arose before or are caused by such termination remain unaffected. The stipulations on termination of rights according to Section 6 of this ISL remain unaffected.
